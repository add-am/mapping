    Description: 
      Abstract: 
      Subcatchments of the Burdekin basin, with the purpose of creating a 
      wetland inventory per subcatchment for the CCI project. This layer has 
      been created by grouping subcatchments from the Burdekin subcatchment 
      layer from the BDTNRM, to fit within a broad subcatchment classification 
      developed by ACTFR/BDTNRM. The goal was to create approximately 50 
      subcatchment of similar size, which do not cross the broad subactchment 
      classification (Upper Burdekin, Central Burdekin, Cape River, 
      Belyando-Suttor and Bowen Broken subcatchments) 
      Purpose: To be used for the wetland inventory / CCI project
