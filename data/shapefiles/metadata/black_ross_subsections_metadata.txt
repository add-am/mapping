black_ross_subsections.shp Metadata


Projection: 
MGA_Zone55

Datum:
GDA 1994

Background information:
The catchments data depicted in thin the black_ross_subsections.shp dataset conforms with the following classification system for catchment boundaries.

a. Drainage Basins: synomynous with the Australian Water Resources Management Committee (WRMC) basins.
b. Subcatchments: unique/distinct drainage areas constructed by grouping connected subsections.*
c. Subsections: the finest scale drainage areas.   

 *Subcatchments are not recorded in this dataset. 

Source: 
The black_ross_subsections.shp datset has been created using linework from the BDTNRM Burdekin_Subcatchments.shp datalayer created by Rod Nielson (see burdekin_subcatchments_metadata.txt). The Wild Bear Creek subsection was added with the aid of 100k Topo drainage data. The Magnetic Island subsections line work sourced from TTCC_Catchments1996.shp datalayer (No metadata exists for this layer however subcatchment boundaries appeared to be generally consistent with 100k Topo drainage data).  

The following topological checks have been carried out and errors fixed:

1. Checks for overlapping polygons.
2. Checks for gaps.
  
 

Attributes:
Island Type = type of feature (i.e. mainland, island, etc).
WRMC Basin = Australian Water Resources Management Committee (WRMC) basin.
WQIP_Area = WQIP area (i.e. Burdekin, Black/Ross, etc).
ACTFR_Basi = Australian Centre for Tropical Freshwater Research (ACTFR) Basin (groups of subsections).
Subsect = the finest scale drainage areas (synomonous with EPA AquaBAMM Subsections).
