## Test 1

Can I read in an output from a variable path? Yes (but the chunk below is commented out for that section).

``` {r}
#| label: find variable path

#get the date
date <- format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%d")

#create the file path
#save_path <- glue::glue("output/{date}_n3-basin-builder/")

#grab whatever we are looking for
#shape <- sf::st_read(dsn = glue::glue("{save_path}"),
                     #layer = "Dry-Tropics-Basins-Detailed")

#get from here instead
shape <- sf::st_read(dsn = "data/shapefiles/",
                     layer = "Dry-Tropics-Basins-Detailed")

#display
plot(shape["sub_zone"])

```


## Test 2

Can I display images using quarto in-text methods?

![3D Map MWI](images/MWI 3D example.png)

## Test 3

Can I get tables? Yes (but chunk below is also commented out as file isnt there currently)


``` {r}
#| label: read from static path

#tb <- read.csv("images/2022-11-07_annual-ltm-rainfall_fyear-2021.csv")

#head(tb)


```
